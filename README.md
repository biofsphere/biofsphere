### Hi there, I'm Fernando J. Soares ðŸ‘‹

Admin at [Quadrat A&D Socioenvironmental Ltd.](http://www.quadrat.bio.br), a small environmental business located in the southernmost state of Brazil. For 12 years our work involved conducting field surveys, flora and fauna inventories, analyzing potential sources of pollution, assessing environmental impacts, and working with environmental laws and regulations. Tired of the conflicting issues, unresolved problems, and legal uncertainties associated with business requirements and government demands, we decided to adopt a different approach. Today we invest our efforts in promoting content and the exchange of ideas, as well as services and products that are emerging in the environmental market. We started by writing [ManTAU](https://github.com/biofsphere/mantau-ivoti), a technical manual to help the small town of [Ivoti](https://www.ivoti.rs.gov.br) take better care of its urban trees. Then we found ourselves at the forefront of the SINOSFERA development, a system that aims to monitor environmental public policy implementation by supporting multiple community initiatives, with a project management platform. Lately, we have been working on an online environmental marketplace to assist small businesses like ours to succeed. This is what we do because we believe biodiversity deserves better. In fact...

As for myself, it comes with the territory: I am primarily interested in coding for initiatives that directly support sustainable development, especially those projects that contribute to the conservation of biodiversity**. It is a jungle out there (literally), and my weapons of survival are Python and Django. If you want to get in touch, do not hesitate to send me an email at fernando@quadrat.bio.br, or DM me right here at @biofsphere.
