- 👋 Hi, I’m @biofsphere, the CIO for Quadrat Assessoria e Desenvolvimento Socioambiental Ltd. :)
- 👀 I’m interested in coding for conservation biology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django and a lot of other IT tid bits around it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python, Julia, data science, and web development for conservation biologists.
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, for now I guess you can just send me an email to hq@quadrat.bio.br, or DM me to @biofsphere.
